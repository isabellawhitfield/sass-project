        <h2 class="heading1">Psychology of Dogs</h2>

          <p>Every action of dogs suggests something about their thoughts or feelings. New studies about dogs have provided an insight to it. Following are some of the facts that tell about dog psychology:
MRI of a dog’s brain has indicated that it works positively as that of a human child. This is why on seeing human positive feelings are aroused in the dogs.
Male dogs will always prefer to play with female dogs, whereas female dogs do not discriminate between playmates.</p><button class="btn">read more . . </button>
Dogs are four times more likely to become aggressive or bite when walked by a male as it is thought that it catches the emotions of the walkers easily.
According to recent study, dog’s response to verbal and non verbal cues is at the similar level to that of a two-year old child. It is also noticed that they understand basic sign language also.
Dogs can learn quickly by modeling other dogs that is why it is easier to train a new puppy with an already trained elderly dog in the house.
Dogs signal their intent to play to other dogs by indicating a “play-bow” or “face-pawed” action.
Dogs possess this great empathetic concern. A study has found out that when a dog notices a stranger crying or acting to cry, they immediately run towards it and start sniffing and licking the stranger, instead of going towards their master who is their usual source of comfort.
Dogs prefer to mark their territory with their urine or stools. Male dogs prefer to mark vertically so that the smell goes higher in the air. The height of the marking tells other dogs about the size of the dog, as height is an important factor in dominance.
Dogs have general behavioral trait of preferring novelty over familiarity.

        <h2 class="heading2">Pros/Advantages of Dog as Your Pet</h2>

          <p>They are Empathetic: Dogs understand human mood more aptly than other humans. They can understand whether your day was rough or good by just looking at your face. Their mood depends on yours, if you look unhappy so do they. They try everything to cheer you up whenever you feel down even if it is only through the way of sympathizing.
You are never alone with them: There are times when one feels alone and wants to stay away from humans, but your dog won’t let you be. It will come wagging its tail gently by just sensing you are down and won’t leave you until you feel better.
You’ll always feel protected: They’ll make you feel safe anytime, wherever you go. Though this applies more to big dogs, but small dogs can at least alert you whenever they sense harm.
Man’s best friend: A dog as a pet is a companion, best friend, a therapist or even a cheerleader. It’ll never judge you. It doesn’t care if you have grown fat or are a public nuisance. It’ll treat you with same love and respect. It is loyal even to its own detriment sometimes.
